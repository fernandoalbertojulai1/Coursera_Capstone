The main focus will be to notice and answer the WHERE? question which in this case relates to the geographical location of the most common crimes within the city of Johannesburg. HOW?- The form of weaponry or ways that are used to commit the crimes.WHY?- The reasons that could lead to the successful execution of the most prevalent crimes that is for example theft and robery around tourists is motivated by the assumptions that tourists have enough discretionary income so stealing from them is somewhat justifiable.WHEN?-The most comon season in which a certain type of crime is highly prevalent i.e. the times, days or seasons that have the most reported cases.\n\nAnalytic and Statistical Approach\n\nSince we have a vast number of types of crimes in the location we are looking at, an analytic approach would be good when we are looking at the concrete understanding of the classes of crime we have. Upon understanding the crimes and their classes it would be excellent to use the statistical approach to understand the statistics of these crime classes and those data that are not known e.g the rate of unreported crimes.

Noteable recommendations can be given that are related but not limited to making the Geo-location API compatible with Android,IOS an many other cellphone supporting softwares. Also it has to be easily accessed through downloading platforms like Google Playstore since the greatest challenge could be the problem of low public awareness of the importance of the Geo-location API.
